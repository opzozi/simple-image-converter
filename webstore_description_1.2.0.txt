Right-click to save or copy any image (WebP, AVIF, JPG) as PNG or JPEG. Runs 100% offline with no tracking.

Save any image from the web as a PNG or JPEG file—or copy it to the clipboard—with a single click. Choose your preferred format and quality in Settings.

I built this extension because I was tired of saving images only to find out they were .webp or .avif files that wouldn't open in older editors or upload to certain websites. This tool solves that annoyance instantly by converting them to your preferred format on the fly.

Key Features:
* Simple: Right-click an image and select "Save Image as PNG/JPEG" or "Copy Image as PNG/JPEG".
* Universal: Works on WebP, AVIF, JPG, PNG, and almost any other image format.
* Smart Filenames: Automatically uses website name (not CDN) in filenames. Saves from Facebook? Filename starts with "facebook", not "fbcdn".
* Customizable: Choose PNG (lossless) or JPEG (configurable quality), customize filename patterns, resize images, and more.
* Modern UI: Beautiful settings page with dark mode support and iOS-style toggles.
* Private: Processing happens 100% on your computer. No data is ever sent to a server.
* Lightweight: Built with the latest Manifest V3 standards for minimal memory usage (~5-10 MB RAM).

Why use this?
Modern websites use WebP for speed, but compatibility is still an issue. Use this extension if you need to:
* Edit images in software that doesn't support WebP or AVIF.
* Upload images to CMS platforms that reject AVIF/WebP.
* Avoid using sketchy online converter websites.
* Get properly named files (website name, not CDN provider).
* Convert to JPEG for smaller file sizes when needed.

This extension respects your privacy. It does not collect analytics or user data.
