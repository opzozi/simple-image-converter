# Contributing

Thanks for helping! Please keep contributions focused, polite, and small.

## Getting started
- Clone the repo and install dependencies if needed.
- Load the extension unpacked in Chrome/Edge/Vivaldi from the repo root.

## Branch and commits
- Work off `main`, use short branches if the change is larger.
- Write clear commit messages; one logical change per commit.

## Code style
- Keep code small and readable; avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- Prefer clear errors and minimal logging.
- Internationalization: add strings to all locales when adding UI text.

## Testing
- Manually test: save and copy context menu on a few sites (same-origin and cross-origin images).
- Check lints if available; keep the build clean.

## Pull requests
- Include a short summary of the change and how it was tested.
- Link related issues if they exist.

## Security / privacy
- No data collection or remote calls beyond what the extension needs.
- Report suspected issues privately (see SECURITY.md).
