# Code of Conduct

We expect everyone to be respectful, helpful, and professional.

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, personal attacks, hate speech, or sustained disruption. If someone asks you to stop, stop.

Report issues to the maintainers via email or a private issue. We will review in good faith and may take actions such as warnings or removal from the project spaces.
